# Nutritional Information Project
### Introduction

This is a React web application. This app was developed to help me replace foods in my diet. It lists substitute foods and calculates the required amount of it. You can also add a new food to the list. All you have to do is add the nutritional values of the new food. It's responsive, so I can use it on any device, whether on a cell phone or on a computer.

 ## Why?
 
 I wanted to practice my knowledge of React components, hooks and React Router. I also wanted to create features that make easy to calculate the amount of food that replaces my meal plan.
